# BankAccountsManager
This project is a simple but powerful C++ console-based application for managing bank accounts. It allows you to store, modify, and interact with customer data such as names, balances, and transactions (deposits/withdrawals), all through a clean text file interface.

💡 Features
View full list of clients

Add new clients with full information

Delete or update existing accounts

Find client details by account number

Perform financial transactions (Deposit / Withdraw)

View total balance across all clients

File-based storage (read/write client data in a structured format)

🧰 Technologies Used
C++ Standard Library (iostream, fstream, string, vector)

Custom input handling via MyInputLib.h

Text-based file persistence

📂 File Descriptions
main.cpp: The core logic of the banking system.

MyInputLib.h: Custom input helper library.

Bank Project.txt: The data file used to store and manage client information.

.gitignore: To avoid committing binary files or test data.

🎯 Objective
This project helped me practice and apply core C++ concepts such as file I/O, vectors, string manipulation, enums, and structured program design. It's a useful tool to demonstrate how structured data can be handled through code, and it could be the foundation for more advanced systems.
